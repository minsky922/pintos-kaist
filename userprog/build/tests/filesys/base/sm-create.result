  (sm-create) open "blargle" for verification
  (sm-create) verified contents of "blargle"
  (sm-create) close "blargle"
  (sm-create) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (sm-create) begin
  (sm-create) create "blargle"
  (sm-create) open "blargle" for verification
- (sm-create) verified contents of "blargle"
- (sm-create) close "blargle"
